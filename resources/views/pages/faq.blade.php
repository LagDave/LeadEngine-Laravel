                        On average, LeadEngine clients are seeing between 10-50 qualified leads per month for every 1,000 prospects engaged.<br><br>

                        The total amount of qualfied leads depends on the following factors:<br><br>

                        - How great is product your market fit?<br>
                        - How active is your target audience on LinkedIn?<br>
                        - How much can you differentiate yourself from competition?<br>
                        - How professional and persuasive is your LinkedIn profile?<br>
                        - How clear and persuasive is your cold outreach messages?<br>

                        LeadEngine  keeps track and sends monthly metrics reports of your LinkedIn outreach data (total prospects, connections sent, connections accepted, prospects messaged, total responses, messages sent, etc).<br><br>

                        Also, LeadEngine sends a monthly CSV list of all prospects (and their valid business email addresses) that have been engaged if you are subscribed to the Platinum plan.<br><br>

                        Recommendations to further attribute success and track metrics:<br>
                        1. Track all positive responses and leads in a CRM or Google Sheets.<br>
                        2. Hit the “Archive Message” button within LinkedIn everytime you earn a positive response, so you can review them later.<br>
                        3. Use a CRM (e.g. Hubspot) that allows you to pull your prospects contact information directly from LinkedIn using a google chrome extension.<br>

                        If you sign up for LeadEngine, we will optimize your LinkedIn account headline and make profile picture recommendations as part of the onboarding process in order to increase your response rates. <br><br>
                        
                        We've found that a well-done LinkedIn profile gets the highest response rates.

                        The exact cost of LinkedIn Sales Navigator is $79.99/month (your 1st month is free).

                        What makes Leadengine’s lead generation campaigns so successful is that the outreach is coming directly from you or someone else at your company. <br><br>

                        Adding that extra personal touch will increase your positive response rate drastically.
