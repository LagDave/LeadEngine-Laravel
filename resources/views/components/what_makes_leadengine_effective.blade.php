                <p class=" text-grey text-dbl-line-height text-normal text-primary">We work with you and compose outreach messages and send thousands of personalized messages to your new connections about how you can add value to their business. The result will depend on what you wanted to happen, whether you want to direct them to your website, schedule a call, etc. It’s an optional feature because of the fact that some clients would prefer engaging them through their email campaign.</p>

                <p class=" text-grey text-dbl-line-height text-normal text-primary">If we use the auto message for new connections, your routine is just responding to prospects in your inbox. Everything is automated, once your prospect responds, then take over the conversation. Like one of our clients said “two things I love in the morning - coffee and warm leads”.</p>
